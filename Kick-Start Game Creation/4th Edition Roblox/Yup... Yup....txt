I am flat-out copying roblox. I really fucking hate Roblox, but it does have some good features. Those features won't be put here.

I can't fucking make a plug-in for the life of me (unless it is easy).

----------------------------------

So what is this about? Simple. Copying the good genres in roblox to make it easy. These are:
Tycoons, Simulators, Trading games, and others without having to abide by Roblox rules or their shitty payment systems.
