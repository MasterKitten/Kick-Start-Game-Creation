# Kick-Start-Game-Creation

Welcome to this repository. As of writing this, I am 16. I am trying to learn as much of the Godot game engine as possible, but in order to do that I need to be able to create some lovely things.

Here is all that I have ever created, and you can use it to quickly get a game prototype or indie game off the ground.

Currently Using: Godot_v3.5-rc4_win64

Project Size: 22.9 MB

Current Features [All of these have examples]:

[1D] User Interface - Calculator, Computer, Computer Role-Playing Game, Godot Splash Screen, Idle Game, Slot Machine (with rigging mechanic), Typing Adventure Game

2D Scene - 2D Platformer, Breakout, Endless Runner, Endless Shoot-Em-Up, Pet Simulator, Rhythm Game, Super Auto Pets, Top-Down Shooter, Visual Novel, Volume Visualizer

3D Scene - 2.5D Platformer (named 3D & 2D Platformer), 3D Music Visualizer, 3D Platformer, Punch-Out Clone

Roblox Clones - Tycoon

Go to the Wiki on this GitHub to figure out how to use it! (it shouldn't be too hard!)
