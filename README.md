# Kick-Start-Game-Creation

Welcome to this repository. As of writing this, I am 16. I am trying to learn as much of the Godot game engine as possible, but in order to do that I need to be able to create some lovely things.

Here is all that I have ever created, and you can use it to quickly get a game prototype or indie game off the ground.

Currently Using: Godot_v3.5-rc4_win64

Current Features [All of these have examples]: [1D] User Interface - Calculator, Idle Game, Slot Machine (with rigging mechanic), Computer
| 2D Scene - Rhythm Game, Visual Novel
| 3D Scene - {}

Go to the Wiki on this GitHub to figure out how to use it! (it shouldn't be too hard!)
